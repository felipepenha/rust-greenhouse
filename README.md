# Greenhouse

A containerized Rust framework for a better Data X development workflow. Where X = Science, Engineering, Analytics, etc.


The name "Greenhouse" is a metaphor. A greenhouse is a structure made of glass to grow plants despite of external conditions such as a cold winter. Likewise, the Greenhouse framework builds a standalone container for Rust developmet which is fully transparent to the user.


# Quick Start

This is a template repository. [Follow this link for instructions to create a repository from a template](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template#creating-a-repository-from-a-template).


First, make sure `make`, `docker` and `docker-compose` are installed in your system.


The greenhouse dev work is performed via `make` commands.


To see the most up to date list of available commands run

```bash
$ make help

USAGE

    make <command>
    Include 'sudo' when necessary.
    To avoid using sudo, follow the steps in
    https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/


COMMANDS

    build           build image using cache
    build-no-cache  build image from scratch, and not from cache
    bash            bash REPL (Read-Eval-Print loop), suitable for debugging
    rust            access rust through the Evcxr REPL (Read-Eval-Print loop)
    jupyter         access rust through the Evcxr Jupyter Notebook
    release         Release VERSION (specified in Cargo.toml) on the dev branch

```


To build your greenhouse (as it is), you first need to run:

```bash
$ make build-no-cache
```


To access Jupyter in your local browser:

```bash
$ make rust-jupyter

Use Control-C to stop this server and shut down all kernels (twice to skip confirmation).
    
    To access the notebook, open this file in a browser:
        file:///root/.local/share/jupyter/runtime/nbserver-1-open.html
    Or copy and paste one of these URLs:
        http://(xxxxxxxxxxxx or 127.0.0.1):8888/?token=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```


Next, you simply need to follow the instructions printed out on your own terminal.


In the generic example above, I would paste the following on my browser:

```bash
http://127.0.0.1:8888/?token=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```


Any changes made in the files within the Jupyter interface, for example saved changes in `.rs`, `.ipynb`, and `.py` files, will be reflected in the original files you store locally, and vice-versa. This is ensured by the fact that the whole greenhouse directory is set as a `volume` in the `docker-compose.yml` configuration file.


You may also choose to run code using the REPL (Read-Eval-Print loop) in the terminal by running:

```bash
$ make rust
```


Now, you are ready to start developing Rust code by creating new `.rs` files in the `/src` directory.


During development phase, you can normally test out new code in a Jupyter Notebook, as you would do with Python.


For example, in the file `src/messages.rs` we have a public function defined as

```rust
pub fn hello_world() {
    println!("Hello, world! From `src/message.rs`");
}
```


In the Jupyter Notebook you will be able to access it through

```rust
>> #[path = "/usr/app/src/messages.rs"] mod messages;
>> use messages::hello_world;
```


Next, to actually use the function:

```rust
>> messages::hello_world();

Hello, world! From `src/message.rs`
```


Check out additional examples in the `/notebooks` directory (`.ipynb` files with preffix `example_`).

* `Cargo.toml`: manifest of the package. Dependencies are defined here.
* `src/`: source directory for your Rust package
* `src/lib.rs`: defines your package (ex: which crates are included)
* `src/main.rs`: a script for dev purposes with `$cargo run`
* `messages.rs`: example of crate that yields a "Hello World" message


# Adding External Dependencies

You need to include any external dependencies to the `Cargo.toml` file in addition to the default list:

```toml
[dependencies]
datafusion = "2.0.0"
arrow = "2.0.0"
```


You may also want to change a few lines in the `Dockerfile` to ensure that the correct version of Rust, consistent with your dependencies, is being used. We keep it fixed in the original Greenhouse template at `nightly-2021-01-01`:

```dockerfile
RUN rustup install nightly-2021-01-21
RUN rustup override set nightly-2021-01-21
RUN rustup default nightly-2021-01-21
RUN echo $(rustup show)
```


`$ make build` will print out on your screen the version that is being used, in your own greenhouse. You may want to double-check it by running:

```bash
$ make bash
$ rustup show

Default host: x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
rustup home:  /usr/local/rustup

installed toolchains
--------------------

nightly-2021-01-21-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu (default)
1.49.0-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu

active toolchain
----------------

nightly-2021-01-21-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu (directory override for '/usr/app')
rustc 1.51.0-nightly (a4cbb44ae 2021-01-20)
```


The above output means that, in fact, `nightly-2021-01-01` is being used for `/usr/app`.


## Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery (CI/CD)

Follow the instructins in [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/felipepenha/rust-greenhouse/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md). Be sure to update `Cargo.toml` before each new release on the `dev` branch.

## VS Code Integration

In your local machine:

1. [install VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/linux),

2. install the [`ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers`](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) extension locally,

3. follow the [instructions in the docker docs](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/) to ensure that $USER has root access to docker.

The next time you open up VS Code in the project directory, VS Code should already be running in the greenhouse container, as specified in the manifest `.devcontainer.json`. 

Notice that VS Code will run intilization commands that may take some time to process.

VS Code will already include the [`rust-lang.rust`](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust) and [`matklad.rust-analyzer`](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=matklad.rust-analyzer) extensions, without the need to install it in your own local machine.
